    <p class="centerp">Every UX process is different for the task at hand. So I am going to take you through the process and methods I used in this project.For this project, we took the double diamond approach to discover and define the problem first.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <h4 class="heading" >User Research</h4>
        <p>
            In the discovery phase, we did qualitative research to understand the user´s behavior and asked questions to the client. Which in this case both are Ricola´s employees but share different opinions and interests.
        </p>
       <p>
        I interviewed two employees of Ricola who were not part of the green team of Ricola. During the interview, I asked open questions about sustainability and its value to them. I asked, how they get to know about sustainability steps taken by their company and how they feel about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the gathered insights we realized that other than the green team no one knows about what steps Ricola as the company takes to become sustainable and how they can associate with the green team to anchor sustainability internally in Ricola. We also learned that they believe in their vice-chairman Rasmus and his green team.

    <div class="col"> 
    <p>
        We did multiple brainstorming and ideation workshops to solve the problem at hand. For selecting one idea to move forward with, we used the tool ”How-Now-Wow Matrix” from the hyper island toolbox. We use this for selecting ideas based on feasibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        And finally, we decided on having an interactive isometric image on the landing page representing Ricola, We believed that with the playful theme, people will find it attractive and engaging. We wanted people to learn about Ricola's sustainability efforts and wanted to make the content more engaging for the target audience.

        <p>In our first iteration we tested our idea of having an interactive image on the landing page and navigating through that page to different categories of footsteps.We created digital wireframes so that it's easy to collaborate while working remotely.We chose to go for midfi design mainly because in this case we wanted to test whether or not users feel interested in reading information and what kind of information they are most likely to read.So at the home page we placed an interactive isometric image along with themed based text to guide people.From clicking any of those links on the isometric page user will be navigated to particular themed footsteps and their subcategory.After clicking on sub category user was able to read about the various footsteps taken by their company. We were able to create this design within a day.</p>

            <p>For testing we made a test plan to understand what we want to know from the test and defined what we assumed.From testing in maze we find out that some users like to interact with images and some people find it hard to understand where they are supposed to click even though we hand big font texts along with the interactive image,also after navigating through pages some users lose their interest in reading through the content as the interactive image was the main hold of their interest on the page.</p>

    <h4 class="heading">2nd Iteration</h4>
 
    <p>With that feedback into consideration, I created the 2nd iteration of our prototype this time and made changes to the landing page interactive image.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We took a more pedagogic design approach.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gave clear buttons and navigation so the user would know where to click. Gave them multiple options.
        </li>
        <li>
            Instead of navigating users to a different page for reading through all footsteps, we created clickable cards for each footstep under the specific category.
        </li>
        <li>
            We used a combination of images, graphs, and illustrations to display information.
        </li>
        <li>
            We also came up with the idea of having Avtar of Ricola Green team vice president Rasmus. Because we noticed that employees in Ricola admire Rasmus sustainability efforts and also when he gave his presentation to us about Ricola 28 footsteps we really felt connected,So if Rasmus himself talk to each every employee through this solution this will encourage them to read and anchor the sustainability internally.Even though we couldn´t really test this because of less number of testers.

    <p>
        In usability testing again we got feedback from the user “He liked the design and we noticed that he spent some time reading through the information. He gave us feedback that he would like to see the final design. We also observed that our target audience was a mix of all kinds of people, some like to read through the information, some like to see the actual data in the form of graphs, and some like to see the interpretation of data.
