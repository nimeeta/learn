    <p>
        Bravida works with all systems that bring buildings to life. Bravida offers service and installation across several areas of technology: electrical, heating & plumbing, ventilation and much more. Bravida has historically been a traditional company in a conservative industry. However, making efficient use of possibilities of the technology of today is a top priority that has accelerated the digitalization journey within Bravida.

    <p>In the beginning, we aligned on the following goals with our client to decide the success of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get insights into users behaviour, needs and their preferences.</li>
<li>Finding opportunity areas (key areas) based on user research</li>
<li>Creating new design solution for improving customer ordering experience</li>

            <p>In order to understand our users, me and my team conducted 5 user interviews.We asked open questions to them about their current ordering experience and their experience with Bravida.Also talked about their expectations when it comes to placing an order to get service for a facility under their supervision.</p>
            <p>We used miro to gather and analyze data.As a team we were able to find patterns in the data by putting all data on the miro board.</p>

                We performed expert review analysis to identify usability problems on the existing portal. We put ourselves in users' shoes and tried to accomplish tasks like ordering service on the web portal, reviewing the order, and tracking the order status. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We found some usability issues regarding unclear navigation on the portal, not knowing where to click. As a user, I found it hard to understand the technical language on the portal for both placing and viewing the status of the order. For adding an order , the user has to wait for almost 1 minute for the system to respond
            </p>
            <p>
                By exploring the web portal ourselves, we have been able to understand the problem more accurately.

        <h5>Persona</h5>
    <div class="col"> 
    
        <p>Based on the collected data from user interviews, we created a fictitious persona Loretta Lindqvist to understand the user's needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. It helped us to identify the users for whom we needed to design.</p>


        <p>
            By understanding our users we got insights that users of Bravida are people who work on the managerial level and their daily work life includes multitasking. They are responsible for managing multiple facilities on multiple sites. They needed to be sure that everything works flawlessly under their supervision. Since their hands are already full of many tasks, they wish for an easy and transparent journey while placing an order on the Bravida system. 
The current design of the web portal failed to provide this experience to their customers which made their customers dependent on people. 
 </p>
 <p>
    As we all know in the global digitization era people dependent culture is not sustainable in the long run. Especially when Bravida has 50,000 customers and even adding more with time.

            <p>
                In the storyboard, we lay down an existing user journey for ordering service with Bravida. This storyboard was also helpful for us to present user journeys to the client requirements for the product.

With our new design, we proposed features for the users to view historical order data of the site. That could help users to make better decisions while placing a service order. We aimed to create an easy service order form. We proposed to use user-friendly language on the web portal.

The navigation should feel smooth .Features to get real time updates to track an order on the web portal.

We mapped opportunities with business needs in the value proposition chart. In this chart, I listed the gain creators, pain relievers, and products and services. We further ranked each point from nice to have -to essential in terms of value to the customer.

            There was a use case where the user need to edit the address of the site

            Having filter options on the top of the table was something they were not used to.

            Customizing features was not really a requirement for the user since the user wanted to spend very little time on the system.

            History or active navigation was not visible enough. Maybe it will take some time for users to learn the system.

                Thank you for these weeks and for all the great work that you produced. It’s been very fun and exciting to work with you guys. It’s very inspiring to see what you could come up with in such a short time span and with such limited resources. Really looking forward to making the most out of your deliverables and putting it to work in business as usual.
            </p>
                <p> The material related to the first deliverable (customer journey) was clearly structured, contained a lot of interesting insights and was visually pleasing.</p>
               
                
               <p>The second deliverable, the prototype, was professionally made and also nice to look at! The attention to detail (both design and functionality wise) was highly appreciated.
